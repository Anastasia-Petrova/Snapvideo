/// An access token has one or more scopes, or general domains. The scopes determine the types of access that token
/// does and doesn't permit. During the authentication process, you can specify exactly which scopes your app needs
/// based on the cases below. If you try to make an API request with an access token that doesn't have the right scope,
/// the API will deny the request.
///
/// - Public: Access public member data.
/// - Private: Access private member data. Required for any scope other than public.
/// - Purchased: Access a member's Vimeo On Demand purchase history.
/// - Create: Create new Vimeo resources like albums, groups, channels, and portfolios. To create new videos, you need the upload scope.
/// - Edit: Edit existing Vimeo resources, including videos.
/// - Delete: Delete existing Vimeo resources, including videos.
/// - Interact: Interact with Vimeo resources, such as liking a video or following a member.
/// - Upload: Upload videos.
/// - Stats: Receive live-related statistics.
/// - PromoCodes: Add, remove, and review Vimeo On Demand promotions.
/// - VideoFiles: Access video files belonging to members with Vimeo PRO membership or higher.
///
/// - Note: An authenticated access token with the `public` scope is identical to an unauthenticated access token,
///         except that you can use the `/me` endpoint to refer to the currently logged-in user. Accessing `/me` with
///         an unauthenticated access token generates an error.
